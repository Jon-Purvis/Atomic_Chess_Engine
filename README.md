# Atomic_Chess_Engine

An AI-based engine for Atomic Chess, developed with PyTorch and a convolutional neural network.

## Setup

To run this notebook, you'll need to obtain a Kaggle API key and place it in a `kaggle.json` file within your working repository. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [Kaggle settings](https://www.kaggle.com/settings) and click on "Create New API Token".
2. This will download a file named `kaggle.json` containing your API key.
3. Move `kaggle.json` into your working repository.

After completing these steps, uncomment the lines of code that fetch the dataset from Kaggle.

## Note

In order to get good performance, a lot of training (and therefore time) is required.
