 An AI-based engine for Atomic Chess, developed with PyTorch and a convolutional neural network.\

## Setup
 In order to run this notebook, you will need to obtain a kaggle api key in a kaggle.json file. To do this go to kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/settings] and "click create new token". 
 You will then need to move this into your working repository. After that, uncomment the lines that fetch the dataset from kaggle.
